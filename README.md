Gamelad
=======

gamelad is a (probably-unmantained-forever) original GameBoy (R) emulator.
I developed it from scratch following several references online and it
runs on the STM32F4-DIS hardware wiring a SEGA GENESIS controller.

Status
------

The emulator barely runs, doesn't implement the sound subsystem and is
buggy on the sprites part.

I don't have any intention of fixing it in the near future.
Documentation is practically inexistent and I didn't review the code
before publishing.

License
-------

The uGFX library mandates a GPLv3 license to my understanding.
My code is public domain.
